About
==========
The techniques used in this project are:
* Pico - which is the CMS that aids me in creating and maintaining this website that I'm working on for this course.
* Composer - which is a package manager that helped me install Pico.
* Markdown - which helps me transform text that easier and quicker to write, into html.
* SASS - which is a css preprocessor that grants me the possibility of using e.g. variables and nesting when writing my style in .scss-files, and then compiles these into not only .css-files but also min.css-files.
* Git and GitHub - which allows me to store my code at GitHub, where I later can access its different versions, and if I choose, others have the option of looking at it and contribute.
* Node.js and npm - which manages JavaScript on the serverside, and the node package manager was used to install e.g. SASS, and then offers me to run the desired functions from SASS, e.g. "npm run style" and "npm run lint".
