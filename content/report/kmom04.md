Kmom04
=========

This part of the course focused mostly on the usage of colors and some repetition of the typography from previous assignments. The requirement for this week included to write a report about how three freely chosen websites use colors and typography to display what they have to offer. I chose car rentals, and it was interesting to see how all used their logo as a starting point for designing the rest of their page. It was also clear that they used bright attention-grabbing colors in a similar way when seeking the users attention.

For creating a dark mode version in my portfolio I  took a copy of the style.scss file that contains my themes’ css,  and transformed it into a dark theme css by using a style-dark.scss file. By using variables for the colors, it was easy to copy it and just implement new colors in variables-dark.scss that I import in my style-dark.scss.
In my portfolio I chose to base the colors on a grayscale monochromatic color palette, that I created with the help of colorhexa.com, and I chose to keep my orange as an accent color. The reason why I stuck with the orange is that it’s an energetic happy color, that gives life to the page. Although I didn’t want it jumping out too much so I chose a less vibrant shade. The grayscale is used both in my light mode and my dark mode, with the difference that the dark mode consists of darker shades. So I actively chose to not work with pure white or black colors in either of the modes (due to minimising too much contrast), and tried to make use of the gray lighter colors in my light mode by turning them into e.g. the font color in my dark mode. To make sure the contrast isn’t too little, I ran my website through the contrast validator recommended in this weeks instructions.  To keep the same accent color in my dark mode, and therefore keeping the page together in both modes, I chose to make it partly translucent. I tried to use my accent color to lead the eye of the user, by using lines, hovering effect over links (and framing in dark mode).

Regarding the images in my portfolio, I chose to modify my landing page image by turning it mildy into grayscale, since it still kept its joyful feeling even then. The reason why I didn’t do this or didn’t change the brightness of the images in my analysing report, is that I think it’s important to show them clearly since the purpose was to actively look at the colors that were used. 

My TIL this week is how important it is to use colors, and even more importantly; to not overdo colors since it may result in a page that is painful to look at.
