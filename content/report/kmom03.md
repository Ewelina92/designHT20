Kmom03
=========
In this part of the course the focus was on deepening the understanding of the layout through wireframes that describe how the elements should be placed. This was accomplished mostly with the help of grids, but also Flexbox. I appreciated the assignment, it was clear what’s asked, and a very good introduction to the grid and it’s usage.

I implemented the grid positioning in CSS according to the assignment, and it worked very well. The idea of the grid is easy to understand but slightly harder to actually implement through CSS when you haven’t used it before.  So I appreciated the help from the lectures where I could code-along with the teacher for better understanding, and since I have never used the grid technique before this makes it my most obvious TIL this week. There are many more techniques inside the grid, that I probably will explore further into the course when I have more content in the page.

When it comes to Flexbox, I’ve been using it in the previous course htmlphp, and I feel reasonable comfortable using it to position elements in columns and rows. Which is probably why I chose Flexbox for the report pages that show the whole reflection text together with the sidebar.  I especially like the responsiveness you get from their wrap-alternative, even though I haven’t needed it yet in this course. So I chose to keep flexbox positioning for example in the footer, that I had from the previous assignment. 
I described in my previous reflection text about how I tried to organise my sass-code in different modules, and I’m still doing that. I have therefore not made any changes in my organisation, and the only module created in this kmom03 is the report.scss which contains the sass-code for all report pages.

I chose to remake my layout a little bit this time to make it look more appealing. Instead of multiple accent colors, I chose one accent color (orange)  and I used lines to guide the eyes to the main content of the pages (underlined headings). By using one color and continuously underlining the main header on each page, I aim for decent repetition that keeps the site together. I also removed the flash-image, since I didn’t like to look of it anymore and I think my page looks cleaner and uses the whitespace better right now.
