Project
=========
## Demand 1 - The website

Fot this project, I chose client number one, Ludviga Af Solstråle, that  runs an high-end law firm, and now needed help with creating a smashing website. I started from scratch with a new installation of the Pico-files, that located in me/kmom10/portfolio because it would give me a clear overlook right from the beginning, and it would make my planning easier with a clean slate. The page consists of three pages:

* the landing/home-page that catches the users attention,
* the about-page where Ludviga tells the user about her company and the website (freely interpreted by me),
* the highlights-page where the specific areas of expertise are listed, so the users know what the law firm can help with.

I chose to use an hero image (the same over all pages, except that it changes depending on the theme) - since it feels more modern and posh when I can use a larger image that breathes luxury to market the page. Here, you also can find the logo for the clients company, which I created by using canva.com, and I also decided to use the logo as the favicon.

I chose to place the navigation at the top, in the hero image because it’s a common place to have navigation and it feel natural to seek for it at the top of the page. Further I let the navigation menu shrink for the mobile version so it doesn’t take up space, and it expands only when clicked upon.

I decided that the footer should contain standard information like contact-information and location information. The ability to change theme is also down there, since it’s not the main content of the page - it’s more a feature (the link to the documentation page is also located here, but only available from the about page).

## Demand 2 - Theme

I created a design that I think reflects something a bit more high-class, than middle-class, which is what the client wanted for her “high-end” law firm. To achieve this, I used images that breath suites and expensive accessories into the page, and I also chose colors that seem commonly used with luxury products- light and towards the golden. The images are taken from unsplash.com and therefore free to be used, the color scheme and chosen design elements came out of inspiration regarding luxury products online, and the written information is partly made up by me, and partly borrowed and slightly rewritten both from wikipedia and attorney.se. Some of the design elements used are framing, grid, transparency, color, rule of thirds and repetition. The sass-files used are divided into modules partly depending on which theme they belong to and which page they belong to. To make it easier to manage the colors, I use variable names for the colors and I can therefore by changing in one place, change the color for multiple elements

## Demand 3 - Responsive design and accessibility

To make the page responsive, I used the grid for major elements, and flexbox for smaller. By making sure I have enough breakpoints to capture different screen sizes,  I could adjust how the elements on the page are placed for a pleasant visit no matter screen size.  For example, the mobile version have fewer columns compared to the desktop version, and also more of the screen size is actively used on smaller screens with less margin and padding to the sides. Furthermore, the size of the images used, depend on the screen size which was achieved by using Cimage, which improves the accessibility of the page by e.g. not overloading the network. Other important features, are that all images have an alt-text, the contrast of the page is large enough, that the colors work even for people suffering from different types of colour-blindness and by using a less steep scaling on smaller screens, it’s easer to read. Also making sure that the css-files are minimized, that the html-tags have language attributes and that the tab-indexes are not greater than zero improved the accessibility until it reached 100 by lighthouse on both mobile and desktop.

## Demand 4 - Alternative theme

I made a second theme for my client. This theme has changed design principles, and is also a dark theme, because my client wants her page to be comfortable to look at 24h per day. To manage this, I changed the color palette to a darker version of the monochromatic color used in the light version which delivers a drastic change in appearance. Furthermore, the layout and overall design differs by making use of the whole screen space, by having less framing and letting the colors and negative space guide the eye. Slightly more (and different!) images are used in the dark theme, and the images are also chosen to deliver more life to the page, while still not being too bright. For this theme, the typography was an important element to work with, since I changed the fonts to ones that, in my opinion, are easier to read in dark mode. You can reach the dark theme by pressing the link in the footer.

## Demand 5 - Analysis web design

To decide on trends, I chose to get inspiration from the previous analyses and combined the elements I though could change depending on what’s trendy. I decided on colors, typography and design elements. Colors because they clearly go in trends, which can be seen in the fashion industry, and therefore are an interesting aspect to look at in websites. Typography, since I found it interesting to read about in the course literature how the fonts have developed and how they’ve been used, and therefore found it as also an interesting aspect of what type of fonts, do we want to read right now. Further more, the design elements are valuable, since construction of objects (be it houses, layout in newspapers etc) differ over time, and also websites doesn’t look the same now, as they did years ago. Together, I believe this elements give a pointer to how designers are thinking when developing websites suitable for 2020 and 2021. I chose to look at insurance companies, since there are multiple big ones and they need to meet not only the demands of today, they also still need to prove to their clients, that they are dependable, not only today, but also further in the future. It was interesting to see, that they all applied similar design elements and that their colors didn’t seem to go in trends but kept the association with their company colors.

## Demand 6 - Analysis of the project

To decide on which analysis to make of my own page (only the main content, not the optional alternative theme or the documentation page), I chose to do it as in kmom05, loading speed, since I’ve already looked at the other aspects in the other analysis demand in this project. It’s also interesting to see, if I’ve while developing the project have kept in mind to make it accessible and relatively fast with optimized images. When I conducted the analysis, I was happy to see that I’ve kept this in mind during the developing process. I found it a bit empty to only look at my page, with nothing to compare it to, and I therefore made some comparisons to the websites I analysed in kmom05. This allowed me to put my page into a bigger context, even though it’s far from the size and complexity that can be found in the world wide car rental sites. I found it interesting to see, that it seems to be a common improvement point to optimise images and currently also trying the newer formats. Further, an interesting point, is how there most of the times seems to be unused CSS, and when making the site, I found it a struggle to minimize the amount of it to make sure only the necessary CSS-code is available. Also, by having one CSS-file, it seems to me (I might be wrong) that it’s almost inevitable that there will be unused code when dealing with multiple pages sharing the same css file. 

## General about the project

The project went faster than I thought, and it was surprisingly easy to redo a lot from scratch compared from when doing it for the first time in each week’s assignment. In total, it took around 2 weeks to finish the project with all optional demands. The CSS is what took the most time when creating the page, since it feels like there’s an infinite amount of tweaking-options. The analyzing assignments were also quite time consuming, since I tried to capture the most interesting points without writing two way too long analyses, but they did offer additional repetition of the course. I experienced that the same problems I had during the course, occurred here - like having to make sure I have the right permissions in the different folders. I also had to alter the JavaScript files at row 59 and 64, to make sure it didn't remove the class name from the navigation bar, since the linter didn't approve of using id-selectors in the css/scss-code. I think it was a good ending project for this course, that allowed me to use my knowledge.

## Feedback for the course

This course has definitely grown on me during these weeks. It was a lot harder in the beginning, to grasp how I design something well, with relatively easy measures as fonts and colors. It’s been a personal journey to learn to recognize the patterns and the elements that help in designing a page, and the analysis-assignments clearly showed the need for good design not only visually, but also for the performance. I’m very pleased about my personal development thanks to this course, not only in learning more about design principles, but also in learning to use a CMS and planning better how I choose to structure my code (in modules) and therefore think the grade should be 9 out of 10. The only thing I would suggest a possible change for, is the need for the analyses in the project. They are quite repetitive, and I feel like deeper feedback would be needed from the graders to fully understand how I could write these better a second time. Further more, it was a bit tough to analyse my own page, since my thoughts about design elements, colors, and typography are already present in the documentation page and the performance isn’t set for comparison with other similar pages for a deeper understanding. If analyses should be present, it would be interesting and developing to minimize the pure repetitiveness, and instead give instructions that puts it in a different view. At the moment, I don’t have anyone wanting to learn more about web development and design, and therefore I have nobody to recommend it to right now.
