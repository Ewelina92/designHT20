Kmom01
==========================
In this course I chose to write in English, since I think it's good practice for the future to expand my vocabulary, and it's also in line with a lot of the literature available for this course. 

This part of the course contained the introduction to design, Pico, Markdown, Git and GitHub. I have never used any types of frameworks or CMSs before, so it was a bit of struggle to wrap my head around it all, it's hard to say which was the hardest. Markdown felt pretty straight-forward, I especially appreciated the guide available from GitHub and I look forward to learn more about this technique. It took a while to figure out how a Gist worked, but then it was good practice to write Markdown there - both as practice for Markdown but also practicing using a Gist.

Git and GitHub felt huge, but after doing it once, it felt a lot better and I see the value of storing your code so it's accessible from multiple devices, and especially being able to go back to previous versions. Using ssh-keys so I don't have to type in my username and password every single time is a good idea, although I would have liked to see this part also written in the instructions, and not only mentioned in a video. 

Pico was quite (and is still a bit) confusing for me, in the sense that it's so new and it's hard to understand how this gets initialized. Seeing how it connects through meta.md and different directories seems straightforward though. To try and minimize my confusion I read up on Pico to understand that it generates a basic layout of files etc that you later modify/add to, to make it your own. 

Even though I've created a layout with css in the previous course, it was a bit hard to create and style my own layout here. I followed the guide for cleaning up in index.twig and css, and it made it a lot easier after reading it through a couple of times to understand most of it. I expect this to become easier and easier the more I work with Pico and the files. I chose to keep "Docs" and "Example" in the navigation bar solemnly for me as help when working with Pico, but since it wasn't a requirement to keep I therefore focused the styling on the homepage and the report page (which is why the previous two don't look very fancy when my own theme is chosen).

I don't have many specific thoughts on design, the most general thought is that it's important for how I as a user experience the webpage. It should be easy to read, easy to navigate (because I get quite annoyed when it's hard to navigate) and I don't want to be overwhelmed when I visit a site. I also believe that good design is something that makes the sites user-friendly not only for tech-savvy youngsters, but also for the part of the population that isn't well-versed in the tech field, especially since many tasks that used to be done face-to-face or maybe through the phone, now are moved to the web - like banking or contact with the healthcare. In this course I'm looking forward to learn how I can make sure my future webpages are user-friendly and easy on the eye, so users have a good experience and want to stay. 

I won't choose a single TIL, because there's so much new I've already learned, that you who read may take everything mentioned above as my TIL.
