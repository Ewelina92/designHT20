Analysis 3 - Design Principles
==========================

The goal of this report, is to look at and analyze three personal pages, e.g. portfolios or blogs.

Selection
-----------------------

I used dribbble.com where I searched for portfolios, and then took the three first ones where the creator had linked to their personal site and claimed to be some sort of designer. The chosen pages are seen below.

* Rachel Farn, https://rfarn.com/
* Clay Boan, http://www.clayboan.com/
* Hoang Nguyen, https://hoang.moe/

Method
-----------------------

To define design principles I used the information available from Stribley [2].

Result
-----------------------
Rachel Farn coded her website by herself with the goal to show off her work and make an employer want to hire her. Her design mostly relies on balance, repetition, contrast and the grid, and in combination with light colors, movement and sans serif font named Karla it gives a feeling of a happy knowledgeable person behind it. I think the design benefits the goal, she shows good example of balance when she balances images against text-blocks and also adds movement to these as they slide into view when scrolling, all which guides the eye. She uses contrast briefly above the fold on her landing page to get your attention, while  other pages rely more on the grid and balance.

Clay Boan used wordpress to create a portfolio showing off his skills for future employers. The majority of his single page is based on contrast, black background with white text (a large font-size 88px and 32px on desktop) with the sans serif font "neue-haas-grotesk-display", and some colorful images that move in a slideshow manner to show what he's been working on. He makes use of the grid by using rows and columns. The design gives a feeling of not wasting time on anything else than getting down to business, and letting the images do the talking instead of the rest of the page, which I don't think is the most beneficial tactic. Pure white lines help guide the eyes while scrolling down his page.

Hoang Nguyen used wordpress to create his portfolio with the goal of showing employers that he's their choice. He has a light page where he focuses a lot on movement and depth by using an animated image that follows the user through all his pages (creating repetition) and by visualizing the cursor as a yellow dot where a circle is chasing it when the cursor moves. By balancing images and text, having a sans serif font called Gilroy and using color (yellow seems to be his accent color) his page seems thoroughly made and intrigues the visitor. It feels beneficial to his goal that he did something different, and the design doesn't change much depending on which of his pages you're visiting, except for his sub-pages showing a clearer grid. 

Analysis
-----------------------

From looking at three different portfolios, it's clear that they all have similarities regarding which design elements they chose to include. They all make use of movement, images/colors, typography, contrast and grid. They all chose a sans serif font, which is more modern than a serif font that gives a more classical look [1]. All of them also use movement in combination with their images, which gives life to their page. Boan uses it for full-screen images that he shows in a slideshow, which is nice to just take a break and look at, and Fern uses it to slide her projects and information into place while the user is progressing down her page. Nguyen also uses the movement of his images (animations is maybe a good way of describing it) to give his page depth and intrigues the user. Although the movement connected to the cursor feels a bit too distracting, and the subtle pulsating of white spots to hover over are so subtle it took me a while to understand what he wanted, and would benefit of a clearer guidance. The grid is also clearly used by all (Boan not as much) to give structure to the content, where two columns seems to be their go-to choice. 

Two of the portfolios use clear contrasts more vividly than only making sure the text is comfortably readable, Farn less and Boan more, and I feel personally that Farns is easier on the eye since she uses a very dark blue background on her landing page, instead of a darker black shade as Boan has for his whole page, that in combination with white text feels slightly too much when looking at it. Both Farn and Nguyen chose a more happy looking page, with lighter soft colors which gives a calm feeling while browsing, although I would probably want a darker yellow for the cursor that Nguyen chose. Further, both Farn and Nguyen also use a lot of repetition to tie their separate pages together, by using for example the same color and font, it's obvious that they all fit together.

When looking at my own page, its clear that it's made by someone who hasn't got a lot of experience with style and CSS and the design is simple and basic. What characterizes it is its orange accent color, that guides the eye by using lines by e.g. underlining titles, and by giving an orange effect when hovering over links which also adds to the repetition to tie the pages together. The design, although simple, feels happy, and happy is what I wanted. The simpleness makes it easy to use the page, so it doesn't seem like a downside event though it could look a lot more professional and even easier on the eye by using depth and balance better, which is in line with the portfolios I've been looking at. So I chose to implement a bit more of the movement aspect by adding a movement effect in my gallery. The images now "pop out" when you hover over them, and by giving them a slight box shadow in light mode when hovered over it create a bit more depth. I chose not to create a clear landing page the same way e.g. Farn and Boan have done, since I didn't have the time this week to make that change. The design doesn't change noticeably between the pages, except gallery, analysis and report that more clearly uses a three column grid.
