Analysis 10 - Web design and trends
==========================

In this report, the goal is to analyze three to five websites' design choices to determine if there are any current trends. 

Selection
-----------------------

For my selection I chose to look at five insurance companies that all offer home insurance. For the selection, I used the site [konsument.se](https://www.konsument.se/forsakringsbolag/) that listed swedish insurance companies and picked the five I've heard of before. The following were chosen:
* https://www.if.se/privat 
* https://www.folksam.se/
* https://www.trygghansa.se/
* https://lansforsakringar.se/stockholm/privat/om-oss/ (you need to choose a city)
* https://www.icaforsakring.se/

Method
-----------------------
It's free to decide which aspects fall under web design and trends, and I chose to look at the aspects:
* typography
* color
* major design elements used above the two mentioned above

The tools used were the following:
* Colorzillas color picker to extract the colors.
* Adobe color to analyze their color scheme.
* Inspect element in the browser for font information 
* Beaird et al. [1] and Stribley [2] for gathering information regarding design elements

Result
-----------------------
### If
The main colors are the following:
<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
    <tr>
        <td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color:#E8E0D9">

        <td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FAF9F7">
    </tr>
</table>
<br>

They use the following fonts, and their font size of the body is 18px:

Prominent design elements seem to be the following:

        <td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FFFFFF">
    </tr>
</table>
<br>

They use the following fonts, and their font size of the body is 16px:
* headings: "ApexNew" (look like a sans-serif font)

Prominent design elements seem to be the following:

Prominent design elements seem to be the following:

Analysis
-----------------------

All of these sites offer insurances, which means they want you as a user to trust them. It's clear that sans-serif seem to be the 
most popular type of font family at the moment, since four out of five sites chose to use it. This is in  line with the modern and versatile use that sans-serif fonts offer[1]. Only Folksam went for a pure serif font throughout their site, which gives a feeling of
class, of something lasting, while the other sites seems to value the readability of the sans-serif as a measure for trustworthiness.

All of the sites make good use of the grid to display their offers, where an amount between two to six (more specific three to five) columns seem to dominate. It's used in a similar way, where the type of insurance e.g. home insurance is the heading or main content of a box. The navigation to these offers, is clear and available not only through the navigation menu, but also further down on the landing page where a lot of attention is directed towards those. The exception seems to be Ica Försäkring, where more focus is on different articles regarding insurance topics (e.g. "five common questions about insuring children") than actually directing the user to the information about their offers.

Further more, repetition is widely used by all pages, and depending on which elements of design they chose as prominent, the repetition is clear in different ways, but all pages make sure their colors are prominent on all sub-pages. 

Most pages, seem to choose a color scheme that is in some way similar to their logo. All three of Länsförsäkringars colors are from their logo, TryggHansa uses a blue shade as an accent color (one of the three colors in a triadic color scheme), Folksam has a monochromatic touch from their blue logo but they mix in a sort of split complementary colorscheme of green, pink and blue as accents. IF uses colors fromm its logo, and uses a beige one as an accent color, while Ica seem to use a bit of an analogous inspiration with red and purple. All pages went for a light/white background. 

## What seems most popular right now? Are there any trends?
To sum the above, it seem that right now sans-serif fonts are the go-to-fonts, and the layout of the page should be clearly focused on the grid, where the main content is organized in columns. Another clear trend is the repetition, be it colors, fonts or shapes/layout, it's important that the pages belong together. These design elements are clearly mentioned by Stribley [1] as some of the most important design principles, so I'm not surprised that they are part of the main design elements. There doesn't seem to be any sort of popular color right now, but instead the trend seems to be to build the color scheme from the company colors set from before (as in logos). What can be seen though, is that they all seem to prefer a lightly colored background, so maybe it's possible that light webpages are more trendy than darker colored ones (although a bigger study would need to be conducted to draw conclusions).
