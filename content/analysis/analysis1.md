Analysis 1 - Color and Typography
==========================

In this report, the goal is to analyze three websites' choice of coloring and typography. Their choice should be evaluated
and compared to which feeling I as a user think they want to evoke.

Selection
-----------------------

For my selection I chose to look at three car rental websites. To help me choose, I checked which car rentals are active at Swedens biggest airport Arlanda, and randomly picked three by writing the names on papers and pulling three out. The result was Hertz, Sixt and Europcar. Their pages are following:
* https://www.hertz.se/rentacar/reservation/
* https://www.sixt.se/
* https://www.europcar.se/sv-se

![Hertz above the fold](%base_url%/image/hertz1.png?w=1200)
![Sixt above the fold](%base_url%/image/sixt1.png?w=1200)
![Europcar above the fold](%base_url%/image/europcar1.png?w=1200)

Method
-----------------------

In this report I used the inspector to gather information about which fonts were used for h1, h2, h3 and the body text (html p-tags). Colorzillas color picker was used extract the exact colors from the websites, and was combined with Adobe Color to analyze their color scheme. 

Result
-----------------------

### Hertz
Hertz' main colors consist of the following:
<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
    <tr>
        <td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #000">
        <td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FFD100">
        <td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #016FF4">
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
Further their choice of fonts are listed below:

* h1: "Ride",Muli,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;
* h2: "Ride",Muli,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;
* h3: "Ride",Muli,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;
* body: "Ride",Muli,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;

As seen above, Hertz is consistently using the same type of a sans-serif font throughout their page, with slight modifications like all caps, bold or italic. 

Their color palette originates from their black and yellow logo, and is consistently used throughout their website, although mostly in their header and footer. Their main content has a white background, where the yellow is used as an accent color to guide the user to their main functions and call for attention, while blue is used for complementary guidance to their less important call to action buttons. When examining their colors it seems that they wanted a color that works well with their yellow, and the blue is therefore not far away from the blue variation as a split complementary color.

By reading and browsing on Hertz website, what I think they want to show, is that they want the customer to know that they are big, known and dependable across the globe, and that they have a car for every need. Their logo should be recognized and associated with a good choice. Their landing page (especially above the fold) is optimized to tempt you into booking, and by not asking more than when and where you'd like a car, they show that they are confident that they'll have the car for you. Further they focus on giving the customer reassurance by the use of images, that they care about your safety and work towards making your car rental easy and comfortable.

With their clear connection to their logo, their softer font and their front page content, I as a customer am curious to test them out, and gladly fill out my dates to see what they offer.



### Sixt
Sixt's main colors consist of the following:
<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
    <tr>
        <td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #000">
        <td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #fff">
        <td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FF7D18">
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
Further their choice of fonts are listed below:

* h1: "Roboto Condensed", Arial, Verdana, "Liberation Sans", "Bitstream Vera", sans-serif;
* h2: "Roboto",sans-serif;
* h3: "Roboto",sans-serif;
* body: "Roboto", Arial, Verdana, "Liberation Sans", "Bitstream Vera", sans-serif; 
* body *sometimes overwritten* by: "Roboto Condensed", Arial, Verdana, "Liberation Sans", "Bitstream Vera", sans-serif;

As seen above, Sixt is almost consistently using the same type of a sans-serif font throughout their page. Apart from differences in all caps, bold and italic they also add variation regarding if they use "Roboto Condensed" or regular "Roboto" on their body text. 

Sixt logo is black, white and bright orange and is recurring systematically on their page. They use black and white for high contrast and visibility, and uses their orange as an accent color to draw attention not only to the vital parts of the page, but they also make you connect the color with their brand.

What I think Sixt want to show after browsing their page is that they want you to know that they operate globally, and that they have a wide variety of cars for every situation. Their above the fold focuses on getting you started in making a booking, and as a help they use a short phrase to increase the feeling that you're making a good choice. Sixt want to be your choice when looking for a car to rent, and they manage to push gently by telling you to calculate the price even though the orange clearly draws your attention to their desired action. As a customer I get the feeling that they are telling me that they are confident that if you just spend a few seconds on calculation a price, you'll choose them." 

I think their design is successful in guiding my eyes and making me want to see what they would offer me, and their clear logo is easy to remember.

### Europcar
Europcar's main colors consist of the first three following, whereas the red is used in a minority:
<table style="border-spacing: 4px; border-collapse: separate">
    <tr>
        <td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #FFDD02">
        <td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #009A02">
        <td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #fff">
        <td style="height: 50px; width: 50px; background-color: #E70D40">
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
Further their choice of fonts are listed below:

* h1: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,"Segoe UI",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,"Apple Color Emoji","Segoe UI Emoji","Segoe UI Symbol";
* h2: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,"Segoe UI",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,"Apple Color Emoji","Segoe UI Emoji","Segoe UI Symbol";
* h3: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,"Segoe UI",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,"Apple Color Emoji","Segoe UI Emoji","Segoe UI Symbol";
* body: -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,"Segoe UI",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,"Apple Color Emoji","Segoe UI Emoji","Segoe UI Symbol";


As seen above, Europcar have a consistent use of the same font ont their page, with variations of bold, italic and lower- and uppercase letter. 

Their website is mostly using the three colors from their logo, where white dominates the page even though green is their most prominent logo color. Green seems to be mostly used for some choice-buttons and guidance, and yellow is highlighting their action buttons. Their color palette seems to come entirely from their logo, although green and yellow could be used in an analogous colorscheme, these shades differ and they are far from each other in the color wheel, and there doesn't seem to be a clear accent color either. Even though they do use a red color to accent their discounts, it seems to play a minor role. Their above the fold gives you many choices for booking while asking you for details like age and what type of car you'd like right from the beginning which could potentially save you clicks further throughout the booking-process. It looks like they instantly want you to know that they have a car for you. When you start scrolling they highlight their different offers and discounts and also offer other articles to read. Unfortunately, I think their website is a bit messy (their above the fold less so), my eyes dart around it and I'm not very inclined to make a booking especially after scrolling down since there's a bit too much that draws attention.

Analysis
-----------------------

It's clear that all websites have one distinct goal - to lead their customers to a booking. They all also use their brand colors to some extent to make you have a clear picture of them, they want you to know who they are, and they want you to immediately recognize them when you see them out in the world, for example at the airport. 

It's noticeable though that Hertz and Sixt use their colors more consistently through their page, compared to Europcar which mostly show you the logo. All of them work with contrast, and they all use a bright strong color to draw your attention. Colors contribute to setting a feeling and atmosphere for the website (Stribley, n.d.) and are therefor an important feature. The companies I'm looking at rarely use the color red (Europcar uses it sparely for their promotions), instead they use yellow (Hertz and Europcar) and orange (Sixt), where both are as Beaird et al. (2020) claims active colors that are meant to be noticed due to their energy and visibility. I see a common theme in how Hertz and Sixt use their attention drawing colors. Hertz uses its yellow sparely but effectively, where the spare usage doesn't overwhelm the user, since as Beaird et al. (2020) explains, yellow may become overpowering if there's too much. Further Sixt draws benefit from the fact that Beaird et al. (2020) highlights, that orange tends to draw our attention due to how rarely it occurs in the nature. Europcar on the other hand mixes in yellow, red and green, where the soothing and calming feelings associated with green (Beaird et al., 2020), mix with two attention drawing colors. In my opinion Hertz and Sixt seem more confident in their product offer and they draw attention to where it's needed, they know the people who visit their page already thinks about renting a car, and they go straight to the question. Europcar on the other hand gives me a feeling of that they want to convince you that you need to rent a car by drawing attention to what you could use the car for, it meets the curiosity of the people who just browse the internet looking around.

All of them chose a sans-serif font, which feels more modern and easy compared to a serif font that may give a too classy and expensive appearance, since a serif font according to Beaird et al. (2020) is a font strongly associated with elegance and sophistication. By choosing a sans-serif font, it adds to the websites intention of being for everybody, which in my opinion broadens their client base. 

As an ending note, I would like to comment on how I personally think that safety plays a major role, even though price also is a big consideration, when choosing cars to rent. From these sites, their design choices and landing page content, Hertz and Sixt manage better to appeal trust and confidence in their product to me, compared to Europcar that I believe would benefit from drawing less attention to their discounts, and instead building a clearer view of why I would want to rent a car from them.
